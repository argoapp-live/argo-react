        ArGo is built on Arweave, a new type of storage that backs data with
        sustainable and perpetual endowments. This allows developers to truly store
        data forever â€“ for the very first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to
        remember and preserve apps and version records indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        ArGo is the first service to provide all your frontend deployment on permaweb
        in one place.
